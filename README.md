## v0.12
* Change the name to CW40
* Add global backlight
* Add RGB underglow
* Add Alps compatibility

## v0.11

* Change the mini USB package from SMD to TH


## v0.8-v0.10
* I forget everything that I did, lots of little things
* fixed some unconnected pads (oops)
* cleaned up silkscreens again
* fixed diode pads to fit SOD-123 footprint
* fixed BOM info for components
* rounded PCB edges
* replaced slotted holes with... holes
* added Vcc and Gnd pins to LED expansion
* changed LED expansion pins to 2.54 pitch

## v0.7 - 2013.10.20
* cleaned up silkscreens
* moved 'ROW5' expansion to GPIO7 (still ATMEGA32U4 pin8/PB0)
* added notes
* cleaned up and removed extra libs/mods

## v0.6 - 2013.10.16
* pulled extra pin for ROW5 from ATMEGA pin 8/PB0
* changed drills for holes/slots to work with OSHpark 
* added GPIO4, GPIO5, GPIO6 connectors to ATMEGA pins 26/PD6, 22/PD5, 11/PB3
* ran row and GPIO to 1.27mm headers on right-side of board for interconnect (ribbon cable spacing)

 
## v0.5 - 2013.09.20
* added back missing slot on right side of board
* added LEDs for optional keys from v0.4
